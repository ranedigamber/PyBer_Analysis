# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis

In this assignment we are analyzing data for PyBer a ridesharing company. We are to analyze the ridesharing data from Jan-May 2019 for three city type (urban, suburban and rural). We created a multiple-line chart to visualize data for weekly fare for each city type collected in this time frame. This will eventually help the CEO make informed decisions regarding resource management.
For successful completion of this assignment we have used Pandas to create and manipulate DataFrames and Matplotlib to generate the plots necessary for visualization. 

## Summary Results:
