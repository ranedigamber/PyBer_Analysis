# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis

In this assignment we are analyzing data for PyBer a ridesharing company. We are to analyze the ridesharing data from Jan-May 2019 for three city type (urban, suburban and rural). We created a multiple-line chart to visualize data for weekly fare for each city type collected in this time frame. This will eventually help the CEO make informed decisions regarding resource management.
For successful completion of this assignment we have used Pandas to create and manipulate DataFrames and Matplotlib to generate the plots necessary for visualization. 

## Summary Results:

	2. Suburban: $30.97
	3. Rural: $34.62
    These statistic show that the average fare per ride is higher in rural cities (~47% higher compared to urban cities) and is lowest in urban cities amongst the three.

### How do the average fare per driver compare between the city types   
  * Here is the comparison for the average fare per driver for the city types:
	1. Urban: $16.57 
	2. Suburban: $39.50
